### What is Scuti server?
An open-source Habbo server written in Java, compatible with R63A clients.
An equivalent version written in Python is available on [this page](https://github.com/qgarot/scuti-server-oldschool).

### Aims
The main goal of this project is to revive Habbo oldschool version by offering an open-source emulator easy to custom.
In the future, it will be compatible with [Scuti renderer](https://github.com/kozennnn/scuti-renderer) and 
[Scuti client](https://github.com/kozennnn/scuti-client). Some RP features would be developed soon in order to bring 
back as much as possible the Habbo experience.

### Supporting the development of Scuti
A [Discord server](https://discord.gg/s6fQAPt) is provided for people interested in Scuti projects.

### Tutorials
Some tutorials will be published after the next release.
